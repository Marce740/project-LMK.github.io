        <p>
            <strong>“The Raven”</strong> is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s most iconic poems, blending themes of grief, longing, and the supernatural into a hauntingly lyrical work. The narrative follows a grieving man tormented by the memory of his lost love, Lenore, as he is visited by a mysterious raven. The bird’s repeated utterance of "Nevermore" becomes a refrain that deepens the narrator’s despair, serving as both a literal and symbolic reminder of his hopelessness.
Poe masterfully combines a melancholic tone with musical rhythm, employing trochaic octameter and intricate rhyme schemes to create a hypnotic effect. The poem's dark imagery and gothic atmosphere evoke a sense of unease, while its psychological depth explores the consuming nature of grief and the human tendency to seek meaning—even in the meaningless.
“The Raven” resonates with readers because of its universal themes and its blend of beauty and sorrow. It is a testament to Poe’s ability to merge emotional intensity with technical brilliance, making it a timeless piece of gothic literature.

        <p>
         <strong> “Annabel Lee”</strong> is a poignant and melodic poem that captures Edgar Allan Poe’s recurring themes of love, loss, and eternal devotion. The speaker recounts his deep love for Annabel Lee, a love so powerful that even the angels envied it. Her untimely death, caused by a chilling wind, is attributed to this celestial jealousy, but the speaker insists their bond remains unbroken, transcending death itself.

Poe’s use of repetition, rhyme, and a lullaby-like rhythm intensifies the poem’s dreamlike quality, immersing the reader in the speaker’s profound grief and unwavering love. The imagery of the sea and the ethereal tone create a timeless, otherworldly setting that emphasizes the immortality of their connection.

“Annabel Lee” stands out as one of Poe’s most heartfelt works, blending his gothic style with tender romanticism. It is a celebration of love that endures beyond life, capturing the bittersweet beauty of devotion in the face of tragedy.
