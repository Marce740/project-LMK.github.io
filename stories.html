        <p><strong>“The Tell-Tale Heart”</strong> is a short story by Edgar Allan Poe that delves into themes of guilt, madness, and paranoia. The unnamed narrator insists on their sanity while describing a calculated murder they committed. Obsessed with the old man they live with, the narrator fixates on his "vulture-like" pale blue eye, which fills them with irrational terror.
            Driven by this fixation, the narrator meticulously plans to kill the old man to rid themselves of the eye. For seven nights, they sneak into the old man’s room, waiting for the perfect moment. On the eighth night, the old man wakes up and senses someone in the room. Overcome by fear and rage, the narrator smothers him with a bed and hides the body under the floorboards.
            The crime seems flawless, but the narrator’s guilt manifests as the sound of the old man’s heart beating louder and louder. When the police arrive, responding to reports of a disturbance, the narrator’s confidence crumbles under the imagined sound of the heartbeat. Overwhelmed, they confess to the murder, tearing up the floorboards to reveal the body.
            The story is a chilling exploration of the narrator's descent into madness, showcasing Poe’s mastery of psychological horror.</p>
    
        <h2>The Fall of the House of Usher</h2>
        <p>In <strong>“The Fall of the House of Usher,”</strong> an unnamed narrator visits his childhood friend, Roderick Usher, at his decaying ancestral mansion. Roderick suffers from acute sensitivity and a mysterious mental illness, while his twin sister, Madeline, is afflicted by a debilitating condition that leaves her catatonic at times. The narrator is disturbed by the gloomy atmosphere of the house and its strange influence on the Usher siblings.

            Madeline’s apparent death plunges Roderick into deeper despair. Together, he and the narrator entomb her in the family crypt beneath the house. Days later, during a storm, Roderick becomes increasingly erratic and reveals that he believes they buried Madeline alive. As he speaks, Madeline appears, bloodied and enraged, collapsing on Roderick and killing him as the house itself begins to crumble.
            
            The narrator flees as the mansion collapses into the tarn (a dark, reflective lake) surrounding it, symbolizing the destruction of the Usher family line and the eerie connection between the house and its inhabitants. The story explores themes of decay, madness, and the supernatural, emphasizing Poe’s mastery of gothic horror.

        <h2>The Black Cat</h2>
        <p><strong>“The Black Cat”</strong> is a short story by Edgar Allan Poe that explores themes of guilt, madness, and the darker side of human nature. The story is narrated by an unnamed man who, at the start, describes himself as gentle and kind, particularly toward animals. He and his wife own several pets, but the narrator is particularly fond of a large black cat named Pluto.

            Over time, the narrator becomes increasingly violent and unstable, fueled by alcoholism. In a fit of drunken rage, he gouges out one of Pluto’s eyes and later, consumed by guilt and hatred, he hangs the cat from a tree. That night, the narrator’s house mysteriously burns down, and he notices a strange image of a hanging cat on the remaining wall.
            
            Later, the narrator adopts another black cat that eerily resembles Pluto, except it has a white patch on its chest. The new cat becomes a constant reminder of his guilt, and his mental state worsens. When the cat trips him on the stairs, the narrator lashes out in anger and kills his wife with an axe. To hide the crime, he walls up her body in the basement.
            
            Days later, the police search the house. Confident in his cleverness, the narrator taunts them by tapping the wall where his wife’s body is hidden. To his horror, a loud wailing sound emerges from the wall. The police break it open to find the wife’s corpse—and the black cat, which had been accidentally entombed with her.
            
            The story is a grim tale of guilt and self-destruction, illustrating Poe’s fascination with the psychological consequences of crime.</p>
