        <p><strong>“The Tell-Tale Heart”</strong> is a short story by Edgar Allan Poe that delves into themes of guilt, madness, and paranoia. The unnamed narrator insists on their sanity while describing a calculated murder they committed. Obsessed with the old man they live with, the narrator fixates on his "vulture-like" pale blue eye, which fills them with irrational terror.

            Driven by this fixation, the narrator meticulously plans to kill the old man to rid themselves of the eye. For seven nights, they sneak into the old man’s room, waiting for the perfect moment. On the eighth night, the old man wakes up and senses someone in the room. Overcome by fear and rage, the narrator smothers him with a bed and hides the body under the floorboards.
            
            The crime seems flawless, but the narrator’s guilt manifests as the sound of the old man’s heart beating louder and louder. When the police arrive, responding to reports of a disturbance, the narrator’s confidence crumbles under the imagined sound of the heartbeat. Overwhelmed, they confess to the murder, tearing up the floorboards to reveal the body.
            
            The story is a chilling exploration of the narrator's descent into madness, showcasing Poe’s mastery of psychological horror.</p>
